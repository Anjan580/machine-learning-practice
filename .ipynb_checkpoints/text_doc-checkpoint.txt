A decision tree is a flowchart-like representation, with internal nodes representing features, branches representing rules, and leaf nodes representing algorithm results This versatile supervised machine-learning algorithm applies to both classification and regression problems, ie and power. Decision trees are valued for their interpretability, as the rules they generate are easy to understand.

What is Iterative Dichotomiser3 Algorithm?
ID3 or Iterative Dichotomiser3 Algorithm is used in machine learning for building decision trees from a given dataset. It was developed in 1986 by Ross Quinlan. It is a greedy algorithm that builds a decision tree by recursively partitioning the data set into smaller and smaller subsets until all data points in each subset belong to the same class. It employs a top-down approach, recursively selecting features to split the dataset based on information gain.

Th–µ ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) algorithm is a classic decision tree algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks.ID3 deals primarily with categorical properties, which means that it can efficiently handle objects with a discrete set of values. This property is consistent with its suitability for problems where the input features are categorical rather than continuous.One of the strengths of ID3 is its ability to generate interpretable decision trees. The resulting tree structure is easily understood and visualized, providing insight into the decision-making process. However, ID3 can be sensitive to noisy data and prone to overfitting, capturing details in the training data that may not adequately account for new unseen data.
